Lulu's Sweet Adventure
===========================

This game will be an adventure-style game. The levels will be set up as a maze that the player must navigate through in order to defeat the level. The theme of this game will be foods—specifically comfort food (okay, okay it’s really just junk food). The color scheme will be bright colors and the audio will match the uplifting mood. The main character is a little pig named Lulu. Lulu is trying to get to the diner at the end of the game. To stick with the bubbly, food theme, the color scheme will include a lot of blues, pinks, and purples. The villain will be a mouse named Buster.

### Lulu's Functions
..* When she walks, Lulu will waddle side to side
..* The “up” arrow key will move her forward, the “down” arrow key will move her backward, the “right” arrow key turn her to the right, and the “left” arrow key will turn her to the left
..* She cannot walk through walls
..* When the user presses the spacebar, Lulu will say something – there will a set of 3-4 phrases that the code will cycle through. She will say things like “I’m kind of a pig deal.”, “I’m not piggy about the food I eat!”, and “I stink therefore I ham!”
..* If Lulu runs into Buster, she will lose a life. She will start out with 3 lives. If she loses all 3, it will end in a game over for the user
When she runs into the donut, she will be able to unlock the door to the next level. There will be other food in the maze. If she collects the other food, it will be +10 points. The game will save a leaderboard at the end, so users will want to collect as much food as possible

### Buster's Functions
..* There will be at least one Buster on each level. As the levels get harder, there might be more Busters
..* The user cannot control Buster
..* Buster will be assigned a set path to walk up and down or side to side on each level
..* He cannot walk through walls
..* The user will not be able to remove him from the levels – the user must move around him

### Point Breakdown
..* Collecting a donut = +20 points
..* Collecting any other food = +10 points
..* Unlock a new level = +100 points
..* Collecting garbage (stinky boot, old box, etc) = –10 points
•	Running into Buster = –1 Heart

### Ending the Game
..* The player loses when Lulu loses all 3 of her lives. The player’s points at the time of game over will be the final score for that player
..* The player wins when Lulu unlocks every level and reaches the diner at the end of the last level. Number of levels is TBD.


### Three Feature Set Targets

1. **Low Bar**: There’s a title scene. One level of the maze is complete. The controls to move Lulu work. Food will be scattered throughout the maze. Make sure the donut is collected to trigger the “finish line” that allows the user to win. Buster will be in the level. Lulu dies immediately if she runs into Buster. There will be a “GAME OVER” scene. Lulu can collect food products and points will be tracked for collecting food products. There will be a scene to represent the user won and the game has ended. The camera is fixed to show the entire maze in order for the user to make its way through the maze. This will have a pink, blue, and purple color scheme

2. **Expected Targert**: My expected target will include everything listed in the “low bar” target, but it will include various enhancements. Instead of dying immediately when colliding with Buster, I would like to have Lulu lose a life. This will give the user 3 tries to beat the game before Buster kills the user off. The donut still must trigger access to the “finish line.” I would like to have at least 3 levels – each level gets more difficult (more than one Buster on the more difficult levels; the maze is more complicated, etc). I would also like to have different music for each level. As for the camera, I would like to have the camera show the entire maze for 5 seconds, and then have the camera follow Lulu – i.e. be in Lulu’s perspective. I also want to scatter garbage items throughout the maze to trick the user – if the user collects those garbage items, then they lose points. I also want Lulu to be able to talk when the user presses the space bar. 

3. **High Bar**: The high bar will include everything in my expected target plus some enhancements. The biggest enhancement would be the camera. I would love to have an image that overlooks the level in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen and is basically a mini version of the level. That way, the user can see where she is in the maze and how much further she has to get. The camera will then solely follow Lulu. I would also love if Lulu could drink an energy drink that gives her an extra life. However, this would only give her an extra life if she doesn’t already have 3 lives. Meaning, she cannot have more than 3 lives at a time. Lastly, a cool feature would be if she could eat a vegetable that causes her to grow large and “eat” Buster. If this gets implemented, then there will be more Busters per level. It would also be cool if the game could save a leaderboard. This would allow the player to create a 5 letter username and their score could be saved at the end of the game.
