When Feelings Have Feelings
===========================

My game will have five different colored units moving around the screen. These five units each have meters on what is good for them and what "kills" them. The five units are inspired by the five emotions in the movie, *Inside Out.* 

###Character Breakdown

The yellow unit's name will be called *Merry* and its **good** meter will be filled when another unit says something happy. Its **bad** meter will be filled when another unit says something angry, sad, fearful, or disgusting. 

The blue unit will be called *Gloomy* and its **good** meter will be filled when someone says something sad or gloomy. Its **bad** meter will be filled when someone says something joyful, fearful, angry or disgusting. 

The green unit will be called *Distaste* and its **good** meter will be filled when someone says something distasteful or disgusting. Its **bad** meter will be filled when someone says something joyful, fearful, angry or gloomy. 

The purple unit will be called *Panic* and its **good** meter will be filled when someone says something fearful. Its **bad** meter will be filled when someone says something joyful, angry, gloomy, or distasteful.

The red unit will be called *Rage* and its **good** meter will be filled when someone says something angry. Its **bad** meter will be filled when someone says something joyful, gloomy, distasteful or fearful.


###Objective

The object of this game is to be the last unit standing. For example, If you're *Rage*, you will want to kill off *Merry*, *Gloomy*, *Distaste* and *Panic*. In order to kill off the other units, you have to say things that will fill their bad meters. In order to fill your own good meter, you collect the coins around the arena that match your unit's color. Using the *Rage* example, you would have to collect red coins to fill your good meter. The coins will have phrases on them that match 


Technical Enhancements
-----------------------

As for technical enhancements, I will need to figure out how to implement two-player controls. I need to know how to allow two players to play against each other on the same monitor. I will need to figure out how to make the units disappear once they die. I will need to learn how to create a title screen that allows the user to select a character. I will need to learn how to create the good and bad meters and have them update as they are filled according to the rules of the game. I feel like there might be more technical enhancements I will need to learn, but at the moment, this is all that I can think of.
